# Milestone 2 - Computer Vision RPS

## Learning Point: Teachable Machine

Teachable machine allowed me to create a 'model' based on my images. 
- I showed it images of rock, paper, scissors and nothing. 
- It had a tool to show you it working... it is rather fun. 
- I put the downloaded model into the newly made repo. 


## Learning Point: Conda Environments in Practice

I re-acquanted myself with Conda Enviroments so that I could check that the model was working using some supplied code. 

From there I 
- Tested tha the model was working 
- That the conda environment was set up correctly

## Learning Point: Support
It wasn't working ... so I got experience of the following:
- Start again on a new machine (I had just got a new macbook)
    - This meant setting everything up from stratch.. it was a good exercise
- Placing a support call. Vander was great and we resolved the issue between us. 

## Learning Point: Coding with CV2

I then started coding. 

1. Initially, a simple rock, paper, scissors game based on user input and computer choices (based off a random number generator)
1. I wrapped all this code in a wrapping function called play. 
1. I then added code that took the user's choice from the camera 
1. And extra code to both give a first to 3 wins as well as tidying up the user interface. 

## and finally

I put the whole code into a new class rps, this is in a new file rps.py
