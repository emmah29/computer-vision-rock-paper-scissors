# Computer Vision RPS


Milestone 2
Teachable machine allowed me to create a 'model' based on my images. I showed it images of rock, paper, scissors and nothing. It had a tool to show you it working... it is rather fun. 

I put the downloaded model into the newly made repo. 

From there I tested tha the model was working and that the conda environment was set up correctly. 

I then started coding. Initially, a simple rock, paper, scissors game based on user input and computer choices (based off a random number generator)

I wrapped all this code in a wrapping function called play.
